# kinit-app-android

Thank you very much for helping out with this project!
Please read the following guidelines before making proposals:

## Guidelines

* All suggestions should be raised as an issue or a pull request.
* To submit your pull request, fork the repository, add your commit and submit a pull request to our `master` branch.
* Please adhere to existing code style. We started this project without any knowledge in Kotlin, but wanted 
to experiment, so we are using a mix of Java/Kotlin. We use the [Google Java style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html)
to style our code with only exceptions of allowing a column limit of 120 instead of 100 and using 4 spaces for indentation instead of 2.
* The project includes [codeStyleSettings.xml](.idea/codeStyleSettings.xml) under the .idea folder. We used 
[Google Java style guide for IntelliJ](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/intellij-java-google-style.xml)
to generate this file, after adapting the column limit and identation as specified above. To format your code using the style 
guide on Android Studio, simply go to `Code -> Reformat Code`
